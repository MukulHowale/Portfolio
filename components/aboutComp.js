    When I wrote my first program, I was really exicited to see the
    result. That made me interested to learn programming. Since then,
    I think I have come a long way and it is a long journey ahead and
    I am enjoying every part of it.

        Other than coding, my interest lies in playing video games, listening
        to music, watching anime and cooking.
